Directory for backup files and indent.log: .
YAML settings read
	Reading defaultSettings.yaml from /usr/share/texmf-dist/scripts/latexindent/defaultSettings.yaml
	Home directory is /home/lab (didn't find either indentconfig.yaml or .indentconfig.yaml)
	To specify user settings you would put indentconfig.yaml here: /home/lab/indentconfig.yaml
	Alternatively, you can use the hidden file .indentconfig.yaml as: /home/lab/.indentconfig.yaml
Backup procedure (-w flag active):
	 ./presa.bak0 already exists, incrementing by 1... (see maxNumberOfBackUps and onlyOneBackUp)
	 ./presa.bak1 already exists, incrementing by 1... (see maxNumberOfBackUps and onlyOneBackUp)
	 ./presa.bak2 already exists, incrementing by 1... (see maxNumberOfBackUps and onlyOneBackUp)
	 ./presa.bak3 already exists, incrementing by 1... (see maxNumberOfBackUps and onlyOneBackUp)
	 ./presa.bak4 already exists, incrementing by 1... (see maxNumberOfBackUps and onlyOneBackUp)
	 ./presa.bak5 already exists, incrementing by 1... (see maxNumberOfBackUps and onlyOneBackUp)
	copying presa.tex to ./presa.bak6
List of items: item|myitem (see itemNames)
looking for VERBATIM commands (see verbatimCommands)
looking for FILE CONTENTS environments (see fileContentsEnvironments)
	looking for filecontents*:1 environments
	looking for filecontents:1 environments
	\begin{document} found in body (after searching for filecontents)-- assuming that a preamble exists
	Custom replacement text routine for preamble preamble
	preamble found: LatexIndent::Preamble=HASH(0x555bcd9809d8)
	replaced with ID: LTXIN-TK-preamble1-END
	
	\begin{document}
	NOT storing LTXIN-TK-preamble1-END for indentation -- will store as VERBATIM object (see indentPreamble)
Phase 1: searching for objects
	looking for ENVIRONMENTS
	looking for IFELSEFI
	looking for HEADINGS (chapter, section, part, etc)
	looking for COMMANDS and key = {value}
	looking for SPECIAL begin/end
Objects have been found.
